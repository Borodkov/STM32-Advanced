@par Description

This application guides STM32Cube HAL API users to run a tftp server demonstration
for STM32F7xx devices.

User hs to use a PC SW tool (ex. TFTPD32) to send/receive data to/from micro SD 
card installed in STM327x6G_EVAL board 

If the LCD is used (#define USE_LCD in main.h), log messages will be displayed 
to inform user about ethernet cable status and the IP address value, else this 
will be ensured by LEDs:
  + LED1: ethernet cable is connected.
  + LED2: ethernet cable is not connected.

If a DHCP server is available, a dynamic IP address can be allocated by enabling 
the DHCP process (#define USE_DHCP in main.h) 

The maximum length of filename used to send or to recieve to/from uSD is set to 12 bytes

Note: In this application the Ethernet Link ISR need the System tick interrupt 
to configure the Ethernet MAC, so the Ethernet Link interrupt priority must be 
set lower (numerically greater) than the Systick interrupt priority to ensure 
that the System tick increments while executing the Ethernet Link ISR.

Note: By default, the Ethernet Half duplex mode is not supported in the 
STM327x6G_EVAL board, for more information refer to the HAL_ETH_MspInit() 
function in the ethernetif.c file

@note the system clock (SYSCLK) is configured to run at 200 MHz and 50 MHz is provided 
      at the output PLL divided by PLL_Q. This frequency permit to reach 25 MHz clock 
      needed for SD operation and in line with microSD specification. 
      
Note : ETH_MDIO signal is connected to PA2 which is shared with other signals like SAI2_SCKB.
By default on STM327x6G_EVAL board, PA2 is connected to SAI2_SCKB, so to connect PA2 to ETH_MDIO :
    - jumper JP21 must be on the position 2-3

Note : ETH_MDC is connected to PC1 which is shared with other signals like SAI1_SDA.
By default on STM327x6G_EVAL board, PC1 is connected to SAI1_SDA, so to connect PC1 to ETH_MDC :
    - jumper JP22 must be on the position 2-3

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
      
@note The STM32F7xx devices can reach a maximum clock frequency of 216MHz but as this application uses SDRAM,
      the system clock is limited to 200MHz. Indeed proper functioning of the SDRAM is only guaranteed 
      at a maximum system clock frequency of 200MHz.

For more details about this application, refer to UM1713 "STM32Cube interfacing with LwIP and applications"

@Note If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),that is shared between several processors,
      then it is highly recommended to enable the CPU cache and maintain its coherence at application level.
      In case of constraints it is possible to configure the MPU as "Write through/not shareable" to guarantee the cache coherence at write access but the user
	  has to ensure the cache maintenance at read access though.
      The address and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)  must be properly updated to be aligned to cache line size (32 bytes).

@Note It is recommended to enable the cache and maintain its coherence, but depending on the use case
      It is also possible to configure the MPU as "Write through", to guarantee the write access coherence.
      In that case, the MPU must be configured as Cacheable/Bufferable/Not Shareable.
      Even though the user must manage the cache coherence for read accesses.
      Please refer to the AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”
      Please refer to the AN4839 “Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series”
